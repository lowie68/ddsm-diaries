This project is part of my portfolio. It demonstrates my capability as a Java Developer. It is used by the Diocesan Digest Sound Magazine a part of Lichfield Cathedral. It is a simple tool which is used to generate two rotas each year.
The first rota is for the recording team to schedule recording the articles for the magazine. The second rota is for the duplication team which involves duplicating and copying the MP3 files on to memory sticks which the end users can play
on their memory stick player. The memory sticks are stuffed into pouches and dispatched to the listeners via Royal Mail.
